## Digital Iron Age: Geocomputation with R

(based on a set of data by [Fender 2017](https://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2017/0774))

### Features: 
- Analysis of continuity of preferred land and weather features for the sighting of archaeological pre iron age and iron age sites
- An application of a conventional logistic model to estimate detection probabilities based on a case study featured in [Geocomputation in R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-cv.html)
- An application of geographically weighted generalized regression
- An application of a presence only model based on [species distribution modeling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/vignettes/sdm.pdf)
- Multiple applications of predictive mapping to visualize model results
- Implementation of various algorithms to scrape and process geographic raster data from public sources 

### Predictive Mapping

#### Based on a maximum entropy presence only model

#### Based on a basic logistic model for presence and pseudo nonpresence data
